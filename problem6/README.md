---

## 7. Live Update Mechanism

The service uses real-time mechanisms (WebSockets or SSE) to ensure all connected clients receive instant scoreboard updates.

- **Mechanism:**
  After a score update, the server fetches the updated top 10 scores and broadcasts them to clients.
- **Workflow:**

  1.  The **POST /api/score/update** endpoint processes the score update.
  2.  The updated top 10 list is retrieved from the database.
  3.  A WebSocket or SSE message is sent to all connected clients.
  4.  Clients update their UI with the new scoreboard data.

**Example WebSocket Message:**

```json
{
  "eventType": "scoreUpdate",
  "payload": [
    {
      "userId": "topUser1",
      "score": 3000
    }
    // ... other top scores
  ]
}
```
